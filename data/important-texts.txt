Discovery Story:
-> Moriz was actually part of a completely different galaxy but was sent propelling into our Milkyway by a great explosion millions of miles away from Moriz.
-> Luckily, Moriz was able to withstand the explosion and is now orbiting Sun and is located between Mars' and Earth's orbit.

Scientific facts:
-> It is suitable for life.
-> It is completely covered by land and water is only found deep undergeround.
-> Moriz takes 275 days to complete its orbit.
-> It takes 24 hours to complete a rotation cycle just like Earth.
-> Summer stays for 9 months while winter stays only for 3 months.
-> Average temperature at Moriz is 16 celsius.
-> Scientists estimate that about 75% of the human population will have shifted to Moriz by 2053.


Features
-> No harmful bacteria or viruses can live there due to the presence of a special gas which has been named 'Rizmo' by the scientists. Scientists are currently working on bringing the magical Rizmo to Earth.
-> Presence of Rizmo gives the planet its classic purple color
-> Moriz is mostly inhabited by trees which look extremely similar to bonsai trees on Earth except that they absorb CO2 and release O2 20x faster.
-> Soil composition is a bit different than Earth due to the presence of an element called 'Wanza'. This makes the soil extremely fertile and allows the plants to grow quicker than on Earth.
-> There are no water bodies on Moriz. The only source of water is the deep underground water.

Species

1. Bonsar Trees
Bonsar trees may look similar to bonsai trees present on Earth but do not underestimate them.
They are one of the native species that survived supernova explosion.
They absorb CO2 and release O2 20x faster than plants on Earth.
They can also produce all fruits and vegetables available on Earth, all year round no matter what the season.

2. Electrar Trees
Electrar trees may look like something out of a sci-fi movie, but they are a reality.
Scientists have deduced that the electrar trees only produced light before the supernova explosion but now they also produce electricity, thanks to a mutation in their DNA due to the explosion.
Their black part is what performs photosynthesis and it absorbs 100% of the energy provided by sun which means it is extremely efficient.

3. Ramosar
Seems like alien movies were right after all.
Ramosar is an alien spcies that unfortunately did not survive the supernova explosion.
However, there is no need to panic.
Ramosar may look frightening but scientists have discovered that they are way weaker than humans, physically and mentally.
Scientists have also deduced that while the explosion took place, Ramosars were actually fighting each other which indicates the possibility of a civil war.
