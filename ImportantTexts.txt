Discovery Story:
-> Moriz was actually part of a completely different galaxy but was sent propelling into our Milkyway by a great explosion millions of miles away from Moriz.
-> Luckily, Moriz was able to withstand the explosion and is now orbiting Sun and is located between Mars' and Earth's orbit.

Scientific facts:
-> It is suitable for life.
-> It is completely covered by land and water is only found deep undergeround.
-> Moriz takes 275 days to complete its orbit.
-> It takes 24 hours to complete a rotation cycle just like Earth.
-> Summer stays for 9 months while winter stays only for 3 months.
-> Average temperature at Moriz is 16 celsius.
-> Scientists estimate that about 75% of the human population will have shifted to Moriz by 2053.


Features:
-> No harmful bacteria or viruses can live there due to the presence of a special gas which has been named 'Rizmo' by the scientists. Scientists are currently working on bringing the magical Rizmo to Earth.
-> Moriz is mostly inhabited by trees which look extremely similar to bonsai trees on Earth except that they absorb CO2 and release O2 20x faster.
-> Soil composition is a bit different than Earth due to the presence of an element called 'Wanza'. This makes the soil extremely fertile and allows the plants to grow quicker than on Earth.
-> There are no water bodies on Moriz. The only source of water is the deep underground water.
